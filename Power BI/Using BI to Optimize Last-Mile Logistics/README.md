# Using BI to Optimize Last-Mile Logistics

# Objective:
This project explores a large dataset of Amazon deliveries to uncover insights that can improve delivery efficiency and optimize operations. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, delivery performance, product trends, and traffic impactsâ€”both overall and by area.

# 1. Ask the Right Questions (Define the Problem)

## Guiding Questions:

   - What factors affect delivery efficiency?  
   - Which product categories are most and least popular?  
   - How do traffic, delivery area, and vehicle type impact transit time?  
   - When are orders most frequently placed?  
   - What patterns exist in agent performance across different conditions?  

# 2. Collect the Data

## Dataset Source:

The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle and can be found at [Amazon Delivery Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujalsuthar/amazon-delivery-dataset)

## Key Features:

43,648 rows x 16 columns

Covers metrics like:

 - Agent Age (numeric)
 - Agent Rating (decimal)
 - Delivery Time (in minutes)
 - Traffic, Weather, Vehicle (categorical)
 - Area, Order Date, Category

# 3. Clean & Prepare the Data

## Data Cleaning Tasks:

   Removed invalid geolocation values (e.g., stores in the ocean ðŸŒŠ)

   Dropped rows with blank delivery times

   Converted text fields like Agent Age to numeric

   Standardized text formatting for cleaner visuals (e.g., capitalizing vehicle types)

## Feature Engineering:

    Created Month, Weekday, Weekday Name using Power Query date functions

    Built Time_of_Day column using DAX SWITCH() for Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night

    Created Amount_Of_Orders measure to track volume

    Ensured weekday sorting using numerical weekday values

# 4. Analyze the Data

## Descriptive & Exploratory Analysis:

    Majority of deliveries made to Metropolitan areas (30K+ orders)

    Motorcycles were the most used delivery vehicle across all areas

    Evening had the highest order activity, especially Wednesdays and Sundays

    Electronics, books, and jewelry were top products

    Foggy weather saw more deliveries than sunny conditions

    All transit times were under 24 hours, ranging from 10â€“270 minutes

## Time-Series Trends:

    Significant order increases from Feb 18 â€“ Mar 1 (likely due to Presidentâ€™s Day or end-of-month promotions)

    March had the most complete data; February and April had partial coverage

    Delivery times varied significantly based on traffic and area:

        Fastest transit times: low-traffic urban zones

        Slowest: semi-urban in high traffic

## Traffic Pattern Insights:

    Jammed traffic = longest average transit times (148 mins), lowest ratings

    Low traffic = quickest deliveries (101 mins), highest ratings

    Semi-urban = fewest orders, longest transit times, lowest agent ratings

# 5. Share & Visualize Results

## Dashboard Features:

    Multi-filtered views (by area, traffic, time of day, etc.)

    KPIs for agent ratings, transit times, order volumes

    Charts for order frequency by weekday, time of day, and product category

    Heatmaps for traffic impact on performance

    Scaled Y-axis for Avg Transit Time Throughout the Week for consistent interpretation

# 6. Act (Draw Conclusions & Recommend Actions)

## Key Takeaways:

    Optimize routing based on area, traffic, and time of day

    Promote motorcycle usage for congested zones

    Use delivery trends to better forecast demand and staffing needs

    Evening hours (esp. Wednesdays/Thursdays) offer high delivery efficiency

    Monitor agent ratings as a proxy for customer satisfaction and delivery time

    Improve semi-urban logistics by possibly expanding warehouse coverage
