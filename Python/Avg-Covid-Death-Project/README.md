# Average Death from COVID

This project consists of a python script that will open and read a csv file, [CovidDeathCounts.csv]() using the csv library. Once the data is read in columns, Age and COVID-19 Deaths, are extracted, manipulated, and used to calculate the mean age of someone dying from COVID-19 and the standard deviation of the mean. These statistics are then written to file [output.txt]().
