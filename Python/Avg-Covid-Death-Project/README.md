# Average Age of Death from COVID-19

This project consists of a python script that will open and read a csv file, [CovidDeathCounts.csv]() using the [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module. Once the data is read in columns, Age and COVID-19 Deaths, are extracted, manipulated, and used to calculate the mean age of someone dying from COVID-19 and the standard deviation of the mean. These statistics are then written to file [output.txt](https://github.com/ShaunJPartridge/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Avg-Covid-Death-Project/output.txt).

# Modules Used

- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - reads and writes tabular data in CSV format
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) - allows access for mathematical functions used in project

# Result

The average age of someone dying from COVID-19 is: 73.5.
The standard deviation of the mean is: 0.65.
